# F2020_Java_Lab1
Exercise 1:
Write a Java console application (using IDE: eclipse Developer Edition: 2020-06) that is used to
keep records of singers and displays stored record.
Follow the following instructions to develop the application:
Create a class named Singers with the following specifications:

a) 5 instance variables that would store the following singer data (Use recommended variable
naming conventions and appropriate data type for each instance variable): [5 marks]
1) Singer’s id
2) Singer’s name
3) Singer’s address
4) Date of birth
5) Number of albums published

b) Several overloaded constructors that would allow you to construct Singer object with no
arguments, 1 argument, 2 arguments, 3 arguments, 4 arguments, and 5 arguments.
[5 marks]

c) Create Setters and getters for all the instance variables of class Singer. Make sure to have
several setters that would allow you to set the values of individual instance variables of the
singer object. Also create one setter that would allow you to set all the values of the
instance variables at once. Create several getters that would allow you to get the current
individual values of each instance variables of the Singer object. [10 marks]

d) Create the driver class (SingerTest) that would create 1 Singer (singer1) object with the help
of the no argument constructor. Display the default values of the instance variables of this
object singer1. [5 marks]

e) Set the values of each instance variables with the help of setters. Display the values.
